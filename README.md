While all true marathons are the same distance, the races are not created equal! The goal of this consulting project for <a href="https://www.letsdothis.com/">LetsDoThis</a> is to assign a difficulty index to races in order to guide users to their next challenge. This project was done as a part of NYC Insight Data Science program. 

In the interest of space, the data has not been uploaded.
