# LetsDoThis
All marathons are the same distance; however, the courses vary dramatically in difficulty. The goal of this consulting project for <a href="https://www.letsdothis.com/">LetsDoThis</a> is to estimate the difficulty of a race in order to guide users to their next challenge. This project was done as a part of NYC Insight Data Science program. In the interest of space, the scraped and cleaned data has not been uploaded.
